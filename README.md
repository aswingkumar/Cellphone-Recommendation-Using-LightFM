# Cellphone-Recommendation System-Using-LightFM
Here cellphone recommendation system using the LightFM library, leveraging a dataset from Kaggle. This project involves building a matrix factorization model to recommend cellphones to users based on their ratings. The dataset consists of user interactions, including ratings of various cellphone models, which are preprocessed to filter relevant data. Here implemented key functions to create interaction matrices, user and item dictionaries, and a recommendation function to generate personalized suggestions. The model is trained using the Warp loss function, with evaluation metrics such as AUC score and precision at k used to assess its performance. The recommendation system provides tailored cellphone suggestions by analyzing user preferences and patterns in their ratings.
